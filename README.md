# Tensorflow workshop notes

### Incomplete notes below:

Tensor is a multidimensional array. There are different dimensionalities of tensors...

```javascript
const scalar = 5;

const vector = [3, 4, 6];

const tensor = [
  [[3, 5, 8], [3, 5, 8]][([3, 5, 8], [3, 5, 8])][([3, 5, 8], [3, 5, 8])]
];
```

All your inputs need to be a tensor.

They have to be numbers, you can also pass in booleans but it will convert it into 0's and 1's.
